This means that they will be given similar embeddings and appear close to eachother in the PCA graph. I learned this through the lecture slides and experimenting with the embedding projector. Other words like Football gave the results \"Soccer\" and \"hockey\" for example which are all closely related sports, proving that the model is good."
